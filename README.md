# IMPORTANT NOTE

> **DO NOT MERGE** THE BASE WITH ANY OF THE <sup>*</sup>IMPLEMENTATIONS (see below for CONTENT) ! <br>

### CONTENT

> There are two branches, those branches (<sup>*</sup>implementations) are as follows:

- <sup>1</sup>**responsive-canvas-relative_values** : provides you with an example showing how to use relative values for your shape's dimensions regarding *stage's (i.e. canvas wrapping element's)* dimensions
  - **responsive-canvas-relative_values-n-hit-detection** : as titled, which comes with <sup>1</sup>above + primitive hit detection based on [Path2D API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Path2D)

- <sup>2</sup>**responsive-canvas-absolute_values** : provides you with an example showing how to use absolute values for your shape's dimensions regardless *stage's (i.e. canvas wrapping element's)* dimensions
  - **responsive-canvas-absolute_values-n-hit-detection** : as titled, which comes with <sup>2</sup>above + primitive hit detection based on [Path2D API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Path2D)

> **To recap**, both approaches are valid, i.e. whether you  are going to choose _relative_ or _absolute_ measuring, personally I prefer absolute as it's more intuitive to me !
